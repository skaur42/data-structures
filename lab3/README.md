In this lab, you will complete 5 methods in the `SLList` class with **sentinel node**. This class is a generalized version of the [singly linked list class](https://git.io/JtoRO) discussed in the class meetings using [templates](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/).

There are 15 test cases (0.2 pts each) for checking the correctness of your code.

## 1. Clone repository

The new files in the repository are

- `Node.h`: the definition of the `Node` class
- `SLList.h`: the definition of the `SLList` class
- `main.cpp`: the test case; entry of program

The remaining files/directories are similar to those in Lab 1.
You are expected to modify `SLList.h` to add your code for the 5 methods. (Search in the file for "TODO".) If you change the content of other files, DO NOT commit and push them to GitHub.

To clone the remote repository to local machine, run the following commands:

```bash
cd SOME_DIRECTORY
git clone https://github.com/cisc2200/lab2-sp21-YOUR_GITHUB_ID.git
cd lab2-sp21-YOUR_GITHUB_ID
```

## 2. The copy constructor and destructor

You should give your own implementation of the [`SLList(const SLList &other)`](SLList.h#L68) and [`~SLList()`](SLList.h#L74) methods.
The copy constructor should deep-copy the `other` list.
The destructor should `delete` all nodes in the list, including the sentinel node.

**HINT#1:** Copy constructor: similar to the first problem in *"Extra IntList Practice"*.

**HINT#2:** Destructor: traverse through the list and `delete` each node during the traversal, in an iterative way.

## 3. Retrieve the i-th item in list

The `get(i)` method in [SLList.h](SLList.h#L80) returns the i-th item in the list. For example, given a list `L=[5,10,15]`. Calling `get(0)` on `L` should return `5`, while `get(1)` and `get(2)` should return `10` and `15`, respectively. **You can assume the item always exists.**

**HINT:** Traverse through the list, stop the traversal when the i-th node is hit, and return the item, in an iterative way; or do it recursively (similar in [`IntList`](https://git.io/JtVl3)).

## 4. Remove the first/last item in list

Method [`removeFirst`](SLList.h#L86) and [`removeLast`](SLList.h#L92) are used to **remove and return** the first and last elements in a list. For example, given a list `L=[1,2,3,4]`, `L.removeFirst()` deletes and returns the first item `1` in `L`. The resulting `L` is now `[2,3,4]`. Calling `L.removeLast()` deletes and returns the last item `4` in `L` and `L` now becomes `[2,3]`. **You may assume the first/last item always exists.**

**HINT#1:** Remove last: refer to [`addLast(x)`](SLList.h#L49); traverse through the list to find the node in front of last node, and after deletion the `next` of this node should be set to `nullptr`.

**HINT#2:** Remove first: the first node is pointed to by `sentinel->next`, and after deletion `sentinel->next` should be updated to the new first node.

## 5. Build and test

A sample test case is given in [main.cpp](main.cpp). You can modify its content to create your own tests. But it will not be used for grading and should not be committed.

The local repository must first be opened in a Docker container to run tests. In VS Code, click on the "><" button in the bottom-left corner and then select *"Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"* to open the local repository in a container.
Next, in the [terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal), run the following command to compile and run the code:

```bash
make clean test # the compilation takes time; please be patient
```

The `test` rule in [Makefile](Makefile#L5) and the autograder both use [Valgrind](valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) to check memory leaks (i.e., memory that was allocated but not released). When you run the test case in `main.cpp`, besides the pass/fail output, you should also see a report generated by Valgrind showing whether there are memory errors:

```
...... (details about test cases omitted)

===============================================================================
test cases: 1 | 1 failed
assertions: 7 | 7 failed

...... (details about memory errors omitted)

==294== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

A successful implementation should have no memory error, as shown below:

```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (7 assertions in 1 test case)

...... (details omitted)

==480== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

## 6. Commit and push

```bash
git add SLList.h # stage your changes locally
git commit -m "add 5 methods" # commit the changes to local repo; the message is for your record and could be arbitrary
git push # push the local commit to GitHub
```

Please refer to the `README.md` file from Lab 1 for more instructions.
